0. EXTENSIVE TESTING!!!

1. Binary <-> text format conversion
   The binary format will accelerate IO operations,
   due to the absence of parsing.
2. (Improved) Boldi-Vigna Compression
3. Fast graph compression/decompression algorithm(s?)
   ensuring the fast execution of the following operations:
     a. Iterate over links
     b. Neigbourghood of a given node
     c. Test if two nodes are adjacent
4. Hypergraphs.
5. Parallel version.

Also:

1. Algorithm for (approximate) minimal cuts.
