Fast graph compression/decompression algorithm(s?)
ensuring the fast execution of the following operations:

1. Iterate over links
2. Neigbourghood of a given node
3. Test if two nodes are adjacent

Also:

1. Algorithm for maximal average degree decomposotion
2. Algorithm for (approximate) minimal cuts
3. Use a binary format for graph representation.
   The binary format will accelerate IO operations,  due to the absence of parsing.
